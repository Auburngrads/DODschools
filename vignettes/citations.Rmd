# Introduction

At its most basic level, a reference citation (hereafter just called a citation) is a data file composed of a group of character strings describing details about a published work.  We often use citations in our writing to refer readers to someone else's work. However, before we can use a citation we need to have methods for

1) Retrieving the raw data files
2) Collecting the data files in a convenient location 
3) Finding a desired citation within our collection 
4) Inserting citations in a document using a specified format

This vignette presents various methods for collecting formatting and inserting citations within an Rmarkdown document.  To accomplish this, we'll use several Base-R functions along with functions defined in the R packages `RefManageR` and `knitcitations`. Both of these packages have been published to the CRAN and can be installed within the R console using the code shown in the chunk below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('RefManageR', 'knitcitations'))
```

Once installed, you should load the functions from these packages into your current R workspace using

```{r}
library(RefManageR)
library(knitcitations)
```

Now that these packages have been installed and their functions loaded, the rest of this document walks through various use cases for collecting, formatting and inserting citations in your thesis or other rmarkdown documents.

# Collecting Citations


# Citing R and R packages

A lot of work goes into making R available for you to use (for free). Therefore, if you use R for your research, you should cite it!  Likewise you should cite any R packages that you use.  The R Core Development team has made it each to generate a citation for R by simply using `citation()` 

    

# Formatting Citations 

We'll want to take advantage of the options for each of these packages

```{r}
# RefManageR Options
```



```{r}
# knitcitations Options
cite_options()
```
## The citation workflow

It's important to recognize that citations come in vaious formats and from many different locations.  The general idea is funnel all of your citations to Maybe you already have a file containing hundreds of citations in a bibTeX format have

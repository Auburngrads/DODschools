# Overview

This vignette outlines various methods for generating and referencing citations within an Rmarkdown document.  Along with the Base-R functions that are available for this purpose, this vignette will also refer to functions from the R packages `RefManageR` and `knitcitations`. Both of these packages have been published to the CRAN and can be installed from within the R console using the code shown in the chunk below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('RefManageR', 'knitcitations'))
```

Once installed, you should load the functions from these packages into your current R workspace using

```{r}
library(RefManageR)
library(knitcitations)
```

Now that these packages have been installed and their functions loaded, the rest of this document walks through various use cases for citing references within your thesis or other rmarkdown document.

We'll want to take advantage of the options for each of these packages
